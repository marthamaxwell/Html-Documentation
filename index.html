          HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the language
          utilized to arrange the organization and content of a webpage. This
          could include structuring text into paragraphs, creating lists with
          bullet points, or adding visual elements like images or tables. The
          main focus of this article is to provide you with a fundamental
          comprehension of HTML and how it works.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="HTML-Defined">
        <header>HTML Defined</header>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
          hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
          bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
          content:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
          </pre>
        <p>
          If we wish for the line to be presented on its own, we have the option
          to designate it as a paragraph by surrounding it with paragraph tags:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
          </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy-of-an-Html-Element">
        <header>Anatomy of an Html Element</header>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
          alt="an html element with identification of it's opening and closing tags, property and property value "
        />
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the
            element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle
            brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
            effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening
            tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element
            name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
            paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard
            beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element,
            which in this case, is just text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag, the closing tag, and
            the content together comprise the element.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Attributes can be assigned to elements and can take on the following
          form:
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
          alt="an html element with it's attributes identified"
        />
        <p>
          Attributes carry supplementary details about an element that you
          wouldn't want to display within the actual content. In the given
          example, "class" represents the attribute name while "editor-note" is
          the attribute value. The purpose of the class attribute is to assign a
          non-unique identifier to an element, allowing it (and any other
          elements with the same class value) to be targeted with style
          information and other properties. Certain attributes, like "required,"
          do not have a value associated with them.
        </p>
        <p>Attributes that assign a value are always characterized by:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
            A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
            if the element already has one or more attributes).
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>
            The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <p id="note">
          <i class="fa fa-1x fa-info"></i>
          <srtong>Note:</srtong> Simple attribute values that don't contain
          ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters <code class="code">" ' ` = < ></code>) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting-Elements">
        <header>Nesting Elements</header>
        <p>
          You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a strong tag element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
          </pre>  
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the p tag element first, then the strong tag element; therefore, we have to close the strong tag element first, then the p tag element. The following is incorrect:</p>
        <pre>  
          <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
        </pre>  
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Void-Elements">
        <header>Void Element</header>
        <p>
          Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the img tag element that we already have in our HTML page:
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
          </pre>  

        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing img tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy-of-an-Html-Document">
        <header>Anatomy of an Html Document</header>
        <p>
          That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
        </p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;</code>
             <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;</code>
              <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
              <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
              <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
            <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
          </pre>  
        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>— the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> — the <head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;</code> — This viewport element ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</p></li>

            <li><p><code class="code">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> —  the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Images">
        <header>Images</header>
        <p>Let's turn our attention to the <code class="code">&lt;img&gt</code>; element again:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt;</code>
          </pre>
        <P>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</P>

        <p> have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</P>
          <ol>
            <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>

            <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:</li>
          </ol>
          <img id="test" src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png" alt="My test image">
        <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Marking-up-text">
        <header>Marking up text</header>
        <p>This section will cover some essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
          <h4 id="Headings">Headings</h4>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, <code class="code">&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</code>, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
              <pre>
                <code>&lt;!-- 4 heading levels: --&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&gt;/h2&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code>
              </pre>
          <h4 id="Paragraphs">Paragraphs</h4>
            <p>As explained above,<code class="code">&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
              <pre>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              </pre>
          <h4 id="Lists">Lists</h4 >
            <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</li>
                <li>Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an <code class="code">&lt;ol&gt;</code> element.</li>
              </ol>
            <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an  <code class="code">&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) element.</p>
            <p> example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
              <pre>
                <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a community of tech's, thinkers, and builders working together…&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              </pre>
            <P>We could modify the markup to this</P>
              <pre>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we're a global community of&lt;/p&gt;</code>

                  <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;li&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;li&gt;</code>
                    <code>&lt;li&gt;builders&lt;li&gt;</code>
                  <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;p&gt;working together…&lt;/p&gt;</code>
              </pre>
 
          <h4 id="Links">Links</h4>
            <p>
              Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                <li>Wrap the text in an <code class="code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element, as shown below:</li>
                 <pre>
                    <code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                </pre> 
                <li>Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:</li>
                  <pre>
                    <code>&lt;a href="">Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                  </pre>  
                <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to:</li>
                  <pre>
                    <code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                  </pre>
              </ol>
            <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the <code>https://</code> or <code>http://</code> part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
